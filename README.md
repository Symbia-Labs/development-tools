# Development Tools

This repository contains tooling, templates, and governance mechanisms used to
support safe, deterministic AI-assisted development. The resources here apply
the Open Epistemic Protocol (OEP) and the Genesis Key Specification (GKS) to
code-generation workflows, IDE integrations, CI pipelines, and automated agents.

The goal of this repository is to ensure that any AI system participating in the
development process operates within clear epistemic, structural, and behavioral
boundaries. These tools do not modify the OEP or GKS specifications; they
implement them.

## Contents

- `governance/`  
  Templates and rules that enforce OEP/GKS boundaries for AI-assisted workflows.

## Intended Use

Projects may adopt these tools to:

- constrain AI coding assistants (e.g., Codex, Copilot, custom models)  
- standardize enforcement of epistemic rules  
- ensure deterministic, auditable development behavior  
- embed GKS primitives (identity, continuity, constraints, lineage) into tooling  
- prevent hidden-memory, unverifiable knowledge, or awareness fabrication  
- prepare environments for Execution Layer integration  

This repository is Apache 2.0 licensed and suitable for any open-source or
enterprise environment.
