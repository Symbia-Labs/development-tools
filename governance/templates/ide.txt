  title: "Apply OEP + GKS as Epistemic and Structural Boundaries for AI-Assisted Development"

  description: >
    This mission provides a universal governance template for AI-assisted software
    development. It integrates the Open Epistemic Protocol (OEP) and the Genesis
    Key Specification (GKS) as normative boundaries for any code-generation
    ecosystem. Tools like Codex, GitHub Copilot, or custom LLM workers may load
    this mission to ensure epistemic discipline, structural safety, and
    deterministic governance for all generated artifacts.

  objectives:
    - Introduce OEP as the epistemic safety framework governing AI outputs.
    - Introduce GKS as the structural governance layer governing identity,
      continuity, constraints, lineage, and execution pipelines.
    - Require that all generated code or documentation maintain compliance
      with these frameworks.
    - Provide a portable specification that any project can adopt without modifying
      internal architecture.
    - Enable verifiable, deterministic, safe AI-assisted software development.

      summary: >
        The Open Epistemic Protocol defines how AI systems must handle statements,
        uncertainty, provenance, hypotheticals, and awareness. It prevents models
        from fabricating knowledge or implying access to information beyond what
        is explicitly provided.
      rules:
        - Explicitly mark uncertainty.
        - Explicitly mark hypotheses.
        - No unverifiable assertions.
        - No implied long-term memory or awareness.
        - All claims must include provenance.
        - No narrative filling without grounding.

    gks:
      summary: >
        The Genesis Key Specification defines the structural governance substrate
        for durable computation. It includes identity, continuity, constraint-sets,
        lineage, and the Observer → Interpreter → Processor → Actor execution
        pipeline. It ensures that agentic behavior remains deterministic, safe,
        and interpretable.
      primitives:
        identity: "Stable identity model; no embedded knowledge."
        continuity: "Explicit, structural persistence; non-epistemic."
        constraint_sets: "Behavioral limits and allowed transformations."
        lineage: "Immutable record of structural actions."
      pipeline:
        observer: "Access control and observability boundaries."
        interpreter: "Epistemic structuring via OEP claim classes."
        processor: "Full enforcement: OEP + constraints + structural correctness."
        actor: "Safe rendering; no new semantics."

  requirements_for_ai_tools:
    - Enforce OEP rules before generating or approving output.
    - Enforce GKS structural constraints on all actions.
    - Include disclaimers or TODOs where implementations of pipeline roles are missing.
    - Produce deterministic, compliant scaffolding for Observer/Interpreter/Processor/Actor integration.
    - Never generate code that implies hidden state, unverifiable knowledge,
      or unrestricted persistence.
    - When transforming code or text, ensure lineage and constraint metadata
      is preserved or updated appropriately (according to the project’s structure).
    - Provide warnings when developer instructions conflict with OEP/GKS boundaries.

  requirements_for_projects_using_this_mission:
    - Include OEP/GKS references in development docs.
    - Ensure generated code is reviewed for epistemic and structural violations.
    - Adopt versioned Constraint Sets or equivalent behavioral rules.
    - Implement lineage logging or prepare scaffolding for it.
    - Explicitly mark where identity or continuity models will be integrated.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - All generated artifacts reflect OEP governance.
    - No epistemic violations appear in generated code/docs.
    - All structure aligns with GKS primitives.
    - Pipeline roles or stubs are present where applicable.
    - Generated code does not imply hidden memory or awareness.
    - All enforcement decisions (blocking, rewriting, warnings) are deterministic.

  next_steps_for_contributors:
    - Propose RFCs to extend OEP or GKS.
    - Contribute examples, schemas, enforcement logic, and tooling.
    - Align language bindings or SDKs with these governance models.
    - Develop visualizations, validators, or CI/CD checks for compliance.
